VoxGuard â€“ Deepfake Audio Detection System
VoxGuard is a Flask-based web application designed to detect deepfake audio using advanced signal processing techniques. The system extracts features such as MFCCs, mel spectrograms, chroma, and more using Librosa, and applies distance-based comparison methods for real vs. fake classification. It includes a user-friendly interface with login/registration (MongoDB), audio upload, and result display with confidence scores. Built using a microservices architecture for scalability and modularity.
